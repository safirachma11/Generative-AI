Requirement                         | Best choice
------------------------------------+--------------------
Local development, simple setup     | ChromaDB
Production, managed, no ops         | Pinecone
Hybrid BM25 + vector search         | Weaviate
Already using PostgreSQL            | pgvector
Maximum scale, self-hosted          | Qdrant or Weaviate

Decision rule: Start with ChromaDB in development. When you go to production,
choose Pinecone if you want zero infrastructure work, or Weaviate/Qdrant if you
need hybrid search or want to self-host.
